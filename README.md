# -First-VideoGame-
My first Attempt at making a Video Game with JavaScript 

# - Running the Game - 
Running this will require you to have node.js 
Phaser is a library used : 
-Phaser is included in the json file. So all that needs to be done is run command 
*npm install* and should install all nessary libraries  

Onced installed, in your terminal cd into the directory and run the following command: 
"npm run dev" - this will locally locally host the HTML file and look something like 
*http://127.0.0.1:5173/* 
open that in your defalt browser and play 

# -Playing the game - 
Use the Arrow Keys to Move 
Press spacebar to shoot
